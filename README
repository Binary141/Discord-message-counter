# Welcome to the repo!

This is a simple project to count out the number of messages in a discord server and be able to track new messages, all matching a specific regex format.


# Usage

Pretty much just add it to a server and start using it. There is a simple `!count` command that will just return the list of users that have had matching messages and the count of the messages that conform to the regex

Upon startup the bot will grab all messages from a given channel, create a dictionary of users with a count of the occurrences, and create a dictionary of all the messages that conform to the regex.

When a new message is sent, it is checked to see if it has already been used, and if it hasn't, then it will increment the count for the user that sent the message
